# Hey there, I'm Mitesh 👋

I'm a Full Stack Developer in the making, a tech geek 🧑‍💻, and a car enthusiast 🚗 who believes in trying everything *at least once* (except maybe jumping out of a plane).

## 🚀 About Me
- 💻 I'm diving deep into **Full Stack Development** with Python and making sure my skills rev up as fast as a Ferrari.
- 🚗 When I’m not coding, I’m probably geeking out over cars, whether it's tech specs or taking one for a spin (no speed limits... almost).
- 🌱 Currently learning: Building full-stack web apps with Python because who needs sleep anyway?
- 🎮 I also enjoy a good video game, but I promise I only code during the loading screens (most of the time).

## 🔧 Technologies I Use

- 💻 **Languages**: Python (my trusty sidekick), JavaScript (we're making progress), HTML/CSS (still trying to look good)
- 🛠️ **Backend**: Django (full power mode)
- ⚙️ **Frontend**: HTML/CSS (still prettier than my code)
- 🖥️ **Databases**: MYSQL (let’s make it work)
- 🌐 **Tools**: Git, GitHub, VS Code (I promise I know how to use it... most of the time)

## 🧠 Fun Facts

- I can tell the difference between a V8 engine and a V6 just by the sound. (A true car enthusiast at heart!)
- I once spent an entire day setting up my smart home gadgets, only for my dog to accidentally turn off the Wi-Fi... all for nothing.
- I treat my car like my laptop — regular updates, occasional tweaks, and the occasional *"why isn't this working?"* moment.
